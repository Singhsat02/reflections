When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Its a good way backup your work. Also great for when you're working with others or would like others to see your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may have made change locally that you dont want to Git to overide.
